  <h3>Why do developed developers hate Front End?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
<h2>What does <em>Front End</em> mean?</h2>
<p>The websiteâ€™s <strong>front end</strong> is everything you see
  and can interact with using a browser.
  So, creating this visual part is called <strong>front-end development</strong>.
  You could even say that designers creating user interfaces and planning experiences
  are also front-end developers, as they are working in collaboration on the same part
  of the project.</p>
<h2>How does <semg>HTML</semg> work?</h2>
<p><strong>HTML</strong> is composed of a series of shortcodes called <strong>tags</strong>,
  normalized into a text-file by a site creator.
  The text is then <strong>stored as an HTML</strong> file and observed through a browser.
  The browser <strong>scans the file and interprets the text</strong> into a visible form,
   and in the best case, renders the page as the designer had planned.</p>
